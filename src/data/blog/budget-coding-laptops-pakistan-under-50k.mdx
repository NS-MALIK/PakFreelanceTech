## Can You Really Code on a 50k Laptop in 2026?
The short answer is **yes**. While brand-new laptops in Pakistan now start well above Rs. 100,000 due to inflation and import duties, the refurbished market in hubs like **Hafeez Centre (Lahore)** and **Techno City (Karachi)** is thriving. 

For coding, you don't need a GPU; you need a solid processor (Core i5 8th Gen minimum), at least 8GB of RAM, and an SSD.

### The Best Budget Picks (Under 50,000 PKR)

| Model | Processor | RAM/SSD | Best For | Est. Price |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**Lenovo ThinkPad L390**](https://amzn.to/4txAaVX) | i5-8th Gen | 8GB / 256GB | Web Dev / Students | Rs. 45,000 |
| [**Dell Latitude 5490**](https://amzn.to/4qBkdvk) | i5-8th Gen | 16GB / 256GB | Multitasking | Rs. 48,000 |
| [**HP ProBook 640 G4**](https://amzn.to/4rSmQKp) | i5-7th Gen | 8GB / 256GB | Reliable Build | Rs. 40,000 |
| [**Lenovo ThinkPad T480**](https://amzn.to/4ttBs4B) | i5-8th Gen | 8GB / 256GB | The "Durable" King | Rs. 50,000 |
| [**Dell Latitude 7390**](https://amzn.to/3MinYb3) | i5-8th Gen | 16GB / 256GB | Portability (13") | Rs. 52,000* |

*\*Note: Prices fluctuate based on condition and dollar rates.*

### 1. The Top Recommendation: Lenovo ThinkPad L390
The L390 is widely considered the best "bang for buck" for computer science students in Pakistan. With an 8th Gen i5, it supports Windows 11 natively and handles VS Code and Android Studio (lightly) without breaking a sweat.
* **Pros:** Exceptional keyboard for long coding sessions, easy to upgrade RAM.
* **Cons:** Plastic build compared to the T-series.

### 2. The Powerhouse: Dell Latitude 5490
If you can find a 5490 with 16GB RAM, grab it. Coding often requires having 20+ Chrome tabs open alongside your IDE, and the extra RAM is a lifesaver.
* **Expert Tip:** Always check the battery health in the BIOS before buying a used Dell.

  <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Most sellers in Hafeez Centre will let you upgrade from 8GB to 16GB RAM for an extra Rs. 4,000–5,000. It is the best investment you can make for coding.

### 3. The Budget King: HP ProBook 640 G4
For those strictly under a 40k budget, the 7th Gen i5 variant of the ProBook 640 G4 is still a workhorse. While it's a generation older, the build quality is superior to most modern entry-level laptops.

### Buying Guide: What to Check at the Shop
1.  **The SSD:** Never buy a laptop with a HDD in 2026. Ensure it has a SATA or NVMe SSD.
2.  **Screen Quality:** Look for "FHD" (1920x1080). Coding on a 720p screen is a nightmare for your eyes.
3.  **Portability:** If you are a student at NUST or FAST, you’ll be carrying this all day. Aim for 14-inch models like the Latitude series.

## Conclusion
You don't need a 2-lac laptop to start your freelancing journey on Upwork. A solid, refurbished ThinkPad or Latitude for 45k is more than enough to learn Python, Javascript, or PHP.
