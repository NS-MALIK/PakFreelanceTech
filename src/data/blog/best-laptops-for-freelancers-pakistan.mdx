## How to Choose the Right Freelance Laptop in 2026
1. **Processor:** Don't go below Intel 12th Gen or Ryzen 5000 series.
2. **RAM:** 16GB is the new 8GB. Don't settle for less if you plan to code.

4. **Warranty:** Look for "Local Warranty" (1 Year) to avoid high repair costs in local markets.

## Final Verdict
* **For high-end pros:** Go for the [**MacBook Air M3**](https://amzn.to/4reDLX4).
* **For student freelancers:** The [**HP ProBook 440 G9**](https://amzn.to/4riPAeR) is a sturdy middle ground.
* **For extreme budget:** Look for [**Refurbished Dell Latitudes**](https://amzn.to/3M2hSv5) (8th Gen) at Hafeez Center.
